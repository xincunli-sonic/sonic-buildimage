# docker image for GCU (Generic Config Updater) container
#
# Design note on sonic-gcu.mk / sonic-gcu.dep:
# -----------------------------------------------
# The sonic-gcu wheel (sonic_gcu-*.whl) is produced by the sonic-utilities
# submodule build (src/sonic-utilities/Makefile) via setup_gcu.py and is
# referenced in slave.mk as SONIC_GCU_WHEEL / SONIC_GCU_PY3.
#
# - rules/sonic-gcu.mk: NOT required here because the wheel is already
#   declared as a build artifact via SONIC_GCU_PY3 in slave.mk and the
#   corresponding rules/sonic-gcu.mk that tracks the submodule source.
#
# - sonic-gcu.dep: NOT included in this Docker .mk because the wheel is
#   installed into a venv with --system-site-packages, so C-extension
#   packages (swsscommon, libyang Python bindings, etc.) from the system are
#   visible. Pure-Python deps (jsonpatch, jsondiff, natsort, etc.) must be
#   declared in the wheel's own install_requires; pip resolves them at image
#   build time from the wheel's embedded metadata.
